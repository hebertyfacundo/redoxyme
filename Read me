CATALASE PROGRAM

The user should start by clicking the Graph XY excel. This button is used to open an excel with line graphs of enzyme activity (Absorbance x Time).

Absorbance 0 sample → initial absorbance of H2O2, which should be close to 0.5. 
Absorbance 60 sample → absorbance at 60 seconds. 
Reaction Volume → total volume in the cuvette. 
Samples Volume → volume of samples in the cuvette. 
mg protein/mL → protein concentration of the original sample.

Formula:
U = (1/60) x ln (Absorbance 0 sample/Absorbance 60 sample)
U total/mL = U x (Reaction volume/Sample volume) 
U/mg protein = (U total/mL)/(concentration of sample protein in mg/mL) 
Results are in U/mg protein. All experiments are conducted at 240 nm.
The result is automatically copied to clipboard so the user may paste in the table provided or in another software
One unit will decompose 1.0 μmol of H2O2 per min at pH 7.0 at 25 °C
Users are expected to enter the data in the table and choose or enter the names or codes of the samples.
Each cell in the table can accept numbers, letters, or symbols. The plot function will not work with letters or symbols

When pressed, the SAVE BUTTON will save a file in the same folder as the REDOXYME.exe file. 
The file will be saved in Excel format (named "catalaseactivity year-month-day hour-minute-second.xlsx"). The user should save it in a different folder.
If the SAVE BUTTON is pressed again, it will SAVE IT AGAIN with the current information of Y-M-D H-min-sec.
The Plot button will create a plot from data. The Graph XY excel button is used to open an excel with traces of enzyme activity.
The trace must be saved in excel as: column A = time values, column B = absorbance values with no additional text or letters.

The user can open the above-saved file or any other file on their computer by pressing the OPEN FILE button. 

The CLEAR button, when pressed, will erase all data. Please, check for proper data in the saved file.

GLUTATHIONE PEROXIDASE PROGRAM

The user should start by clicking the Graph XY excel. This button is used to open an excel with line graphs of enzyme activity (Absorbance x Time).

The user can open the above-saved files or any other file on their computer by pressing the OPEN FILE button.

1 unit of GPx-1 is defined as the amount of enzyme necessary to catalyze the oxidation of 1.0 micromole GSH (by H2O2) to GSSG, per minute at 25 ºC, pH 7.0.
Absorbance 0 Sample → initial absorbance of NAD(P)H 
Absorbance 60 Sample → final absorbance 
Absorbance 0 blank→ initial absorbance of NAD(P)H 
Absorbance 60 blank→ final absorbance of NAD(P)H 
Reaction Volume → total volume in the cuvette
Samples Volume → volume of samples in the cuvette 
Dilution Factor → dilution of sample before adding to the cuvette 
Coefficient extinction of NADPH at 340 nm at 1 cm pathlength is 6.22. If the pathlength is 0.5 consider 3.11. 
mg protein/mL → protein concentration of the original sample

U/mL = U x (Reaction volume/Sample volume) 
U/mg protein = (U total/mL)/concentration of sample protein in mg/mL) 
Results are in U/mg protein or mU/mg protein. All experiments are conducted at 340 nm.

The result is automatically copied to clipboard so the user may paste in the table provided or in another software.

SUPEROXIDE DISMUTASE

Absorbance Blank → absorbance of the blank tube - A1 
Absorbance Sample → absorbance of the sample tube - A2 
Reaction Volume → total volume in the cuvette 
Samples Volume → volume of samples in the cuvette 
mg protein/mL → protein concentration of the original sample

Formula: SOD U/mL = (((A1-A2)/A1)/ 0.5) x (Reaction volume (mL) /Sample volume (mL)) x DF
U/mg protein =SOD U/mL / mg protein/mL 

The result is automatically copied to clipboard so the user may paste in the table provided or in another software.

Users are expected to enter the data in the table and choose or enter the names or codes of the samples.
Each cell in the table can accept numbers, letters, or symbols. The plot function will not work with letters or symbols. 

When pressed, the SAVE BUTTON will save a file in the same folder as the Redoxyme.exe file. 
The file will be saved in Excel format (named "SODactivity year-month-day hour-minute-second.xlsx"). The user should modify the name and save it in a different folder.
If the SAVE BUTTON is pressed again, it will SAVE IT AGAIN with the current information of Y-M-D H-min-sec.
