CATALASE PROGRAM

The user should start by clicking the Graph XY excel button is used to open an excel with traces of enzyme activity.  
 The user can open the above-saved file or any other file on their computer by pressing the OPEN FILE button.   

Absorbance0 → initial absorbance of H2O2, which should be close to 0.5.   
Absorbance60 → absorbance at 60 seconds.   
Reaction Volume → total volume in the cuvette.   
Samples Volume → volume of samples in the cuvette.   
mg protein/mL → protein concentration of the original sample.  
   
 Formula:  
 U = (1/60) x ln (Absorbance0/Absorbance60)  
 U/mL = U x (Reaction volume/Sample volume)   
 U/mg protein = (U total/mL)/(concentration of sample protein in mg/mL)   
 Results are in U/mg protein or mU/mg protein. All experiments are conducted at 240 nm.  
 One unit will decompose 1.0 μmol of H2O2 per min at pH 7.0 at 25 °C  
 Users are expected to enter the data in the table and choose or enter the names or codes of the samples.  
 Each cell in the table can accept numbers, letters, or symbols.  
   
When pressed, the SAVE BUTTON will save a file in the same folder as the REDOXIME.exe file.   
The file will be saved in Excel format (named "catalaseactivity year-month-day hour-minute-second.xlsx"). The user should save it in a different folder.  
If the SAVE BUTTON is pressed again, it will SAVE IT AGAIN with the current information of Y-M-D H-min-sec.  
The Plot button will create a plot from data. 
The CLEAR button, when pressed, will erase all data. Please, check for proper data in the saved file.
